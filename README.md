Numerical methods (such as interpolation and integration) researched and programmed during directed research investigating shock wave blast expansion.
PDF files contain results from more sophisticated routines run on UNC's Dogwood computer cluster with Athena++ simulation data. Not included here as I wrote the code in my Dogwood account.
Note that plotblast contains code mostly written by my advisor.
